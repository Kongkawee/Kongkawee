## Hi It's me, ARM 👋👨🏻‍💻

### 🕊️ About me!

* 👀 My name is Kongkawee Chayarat or you can call me Arm. <br>
* 🎓 I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Kasetsart University. <br>
* 👾 I have learned various programming languages and thoroughly enjoy working with them, such as Python, Java, C#, and C++. <br>
* 🏆 I am passionate about both artwork and coding. My goal is to become a game and AI developer. <br>
* Currently, I'm learning about Artwork, Animation, Music, Sound effects, Plot creation, Various Game engines, and more. <br>
* I love coding because I think coding is like an adventure; we don't know what problems are coming to us. <br>
* I like how we can handle the unexpected problem and also love the feeling when we can pass through it. <br>
